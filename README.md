What to do this project solve? Think about TSP(Traveling SalesmanProblem).

Imagine you want to drop some gifts at these all ten city bank branches starting from City Bank Uttara Branch. 

You are driving a bike on Dhaka roads to visit all those locations. 

Traffic is a concern. Also, distances are not given. You can assign your own distance. 

You want to use the best route, so that you spend a minimum amount of fuel. 

Write a program in Python, that creates the best optimized traffic route for traveling all those locations.
